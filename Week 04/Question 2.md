<h3>E8.1: You work for a furniture company, and you have to ship furniture <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all over the country. You need to pack your truck with boxes. All <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the boxes are of different sizes, and you’re trying to maximize the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;space you use in each truck. How would you pick boxes to maximize <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;space? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;optimal solution?</h3>

<h4>Answer: I would pick the box with the biggest size first then the next biggest size and so on. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It won't give optimal solution.</h4>

<h3>E8.2: You’re going to Europe, and you have seven days to see everything <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can. You assign a point value to each item (how much you want <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to see it) and estimate how long it takes. How can you maximize the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;point total (seeing all the things you really want to see) during your <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stay? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the optimal <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;solution?</h3>

<h4>Answer: I would visit the place with the highest point value then visit the place with the next highest <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;point value and so on. It won't give me the optimal solution.</h4>

<h3>E8.8: You’re making a map of the USA, and you need to color adjacent <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;states with different colors. You have to find the minimum number <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of colors you need so that no two adjacent states are the same color. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this an NP-complete problem?</h3>
