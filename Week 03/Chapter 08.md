<h3>E8.1:You work for a furniture company, and you have to ship furniture <br>
all over the country. You need to pack your truck with boxes. All <br>
the boxes are of different sizes, and you’re trying to maximize the <br>
space you use in each truck. How would you pick boxes to maximize <br>
space? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the <br>
optimal solution?</h3>

<h3>E8.2:You’re going to Europe, and you have seven days to see everything <br>
you can. You assign a point value to each item (how much you want <br>
to see it) and estimate how long it takes. How can you maximize the <br>
point total (seeing all the things you really want to see) during your <br>
stay? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the optimal <br>
solution?</h3>
