<h3>7.1 In each of the graphs, what is the weight of the shortest path from<br>
start to finish?</h3>

<h4>Answer: A) The weight is 8 and this is the path: <img src="">;</h4>

                	          ----------------------------------------

<h4>Answer: B) The weight is 60 and this is the path: <img src="">;</h4>

                	          ----------------------------------------

<h4>Answer: C) It has a negitive weight so I can't use Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm;</h4>
